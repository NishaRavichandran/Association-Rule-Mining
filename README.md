# Association-Rule-Mining
Machine Learning Project - Web Mining

Project Objective:
The objective of this project is to find the correlation between the items purchased from a grocery store. Association rules mining is a rule-based method for discovering interesting relations between variables in large databases which is intended to identify strong rules discovered in databases using some measures of interestingness. We used confidence as a measure of interestingness. The main purpose of this project is to get an in depth understanding of how the Apriori algorithm works.

Association Rule Mining:
We used Apriori algorithm which is a classical algorithm in data mining. It is used for mining frequent itemsets and relevant association rules. It is devised to operate on a database containing a lot of transactions, for instance, items brought by customers in a store.

Technology Used:
We approached the Association Rule Mining via Apriori Algorithm using Python.

Dataset - Data Dictionary:
We used the Groceries Market Basket Dataset, from Kaggle. The dataset contains 7500 transactions by customers shopping for groceries. The data contains 169 unique items.
